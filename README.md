	To perform data preprocessing, including handling missing values and outliers.
	To identify the key factors that influence mobile phone pricing.
	To build predictive models that can accurately estimate mobile phone prices.
	To visualize the results and present actionable insights.


4. Scope of Work
The project will involve the following tasks:
•	Data Exploration: Understanding the dataset, including the features and target variable.
•	Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, removing outliers, and normalizing/standardizing the data.
•	Feature Selection: Identifying the most significant features influencing mobile price range.
•	Data Visualization: Using plots and graphs to visualize the relationship between features and mobile price  range .
•	Interpretation of Results: Analyzing the output of the models .
•	Reporting: Documenting the findings and preparing a final report.
5. Methodology
The project will follow a structured approach:
1.	Data Collection: The dataset will be sourced from a kaggle website.
2.	Data Preprocessing:
o	Handle missing data using imputation techniques.
o	Detect and remove outliers.
o	 standardize the data if necessary.
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o	Use descriptive statistics to summarize the dataset.
o	Create visualizations like histograms,  bar char and pie chart to understand feature distributions and relationships.
4.	Visualization:
o	Generate charts and graphs to visualize the findings.
5.	Reporting:
o	Compile the analysis, results, and insights into a comprehensive report.
